tg4
=====

tg4 is a MOOSE-based application containing the code required to run the thermo-mechanical welding simulation for the NeT Task Group 4 (TG4) benchmark weldment. This includes modification of the heat source for the thermal model, and the implementation of two-stage annealing for the mechanical model.
